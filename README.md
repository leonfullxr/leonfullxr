# Hi 😄

🧘 Completed over 500h of meditation after discovering memory leaks.<br>
:mortar_board: Studying Computer Engineering abroad at [AGH University of Krakow](https://www.agh.edu.pl/) (4º Year)<br>
🏢 Working at [@wazuh](https://github.com/wazuh) as a **Security Engineer**<br>
:seedling: I’m currently **learning AI**, mainly teaching computers to do what I’m too lazy to and focused on **Deep Learning and Cybersecurity**<br>
🔐 On a quest to unlock the mythical **CompTIA Security+** certificate<br>
✍️ Finishing my Final Thesis on [**Elliptic Curve Cryptography**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography). Plot twist: It’s not about circles.<br>

# Technical Skills
* Fluent in Stack Overflow dialect *(read-only mode)*
* Advanced Googling Certification *(PhD level, pending final exam)*
* Certified "Turning-it-off-and-on-again" expert
* Dockerizing existential crises (containers still occasionally leak)

If ‘Commit and Hope’ becomes an industry-standard methodology, I’m switching to Arch.
